Detailed transactions can be found on the following pages.
If you have more than one Citibank credit card and receive separate statements of account for these cards (i) you will need to aggregate the Current Balance and Total Minimum amounts in
these statements to determine your Current Balance and Total Minimum Payment amounts across all your Credit Card accounts and (ii) your Overlimit Amount across all Card accounts will only
be reflected in one of these statements. Accordingly, you should read these statements together.
Please settle this statement promptly (the minimum payment required is stated in the table above). If the Minimum Payment Amount is not received by Payment Due Date, a late charge (if
applicable) will be levied. If the payment of the Current Balance (including any billed instalments) is not made in full by the Payment Due Date, daily interest will be assessed at an effective
interest rate from each transaction date on all transactions/charges in this statement and all transactions/charges posted after this statement date. (Please refer to the back of this statement for
full details)
Please examine this statement immediately. If no discrepancy is reported within 10 days from the date of this statement, the information on this statement of account will be considered as correct
subject to our right to rectify as set out in the cardmember's agreement.
Note: The Current Balance indicated on the payment stub is computed on the sum of Debit Balances only. All Credit Balances are excluded from this calculation.
